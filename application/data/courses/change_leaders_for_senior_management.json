  "desc": "<p>Senior leaders need to be able to articulate a compelling vision for the future in a way that motivates others.</p><p>This 1-day workshop instructs you how to inspire and engage others when leading change.</p><p>Developed in partnership with training experts, Mind Gym, this workshop is split into 3 phases. The first workout (inspiring change) explores why inspiration is so important, and what motivates you.</p><p>The second workout (delivering change) focuses on dealing with resistance - one of the biggest challenges when you’re trying to deliver change. You’ll look at ways to make change happen and the neuroscience of why people react to change the way they do.</p><p>Finally, you’ll get the opportunity to put what you’ve learnt into practice. Working in small groups, you’ll get peer-to-peer advice as well as feedback from a coach. One of the aims is to create an action plan, but there’s also time to reflect and to seek opinions from your peers</p>",
